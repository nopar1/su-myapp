## Took me too long to set up git on website.

### This is written to remind me of the workflow.
Write code in VS Code.  
npm run build  
Copy contents of dist to git repo for su-myapp  
Commit, push contents of su-myapp  
Pull on server (PuTTY)  

### Suggestion to improve workflow
Figure out how to directly "build" React App into su-myapp repo
